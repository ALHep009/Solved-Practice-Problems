### As the program takes an input from the end user, have it count the number of names entered. 
### Then, before the sort names are output, print a message stating how many names were input. 

names = []

while True:
    u = input('Enter a name: ')
    if u == '':
        break
    names.append(u)
    w = len(names)
    print('The number of names input are', w)
    
names.sort() 
##Sort the names in alphabetical order at the end of the program
print('There were', w, 'names input')
print(names)


####Instead of printing sorted names to a line, print them out on the same line

for i in range(len(names)):
    print(names[i])
