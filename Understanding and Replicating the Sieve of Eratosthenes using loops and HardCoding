### Replicating the Sieve of Eratosthenes

# A prime Number is a number that can only be divisible by itself and 1. Unlike even numbers, it can't be divided
# into smaller and equal portions of the divisor. We can replicate the Sieve and use it to return only prime numbers. 

n = int(input("Enter a number, here: "))
bool_list = [True]*100 # This makes a list with 100 entries, all marked as True

for prime in range(2, 100): 
    if bool_list[prime]:
        print(prime, end=' ,')
        for i in range(prime*2, 100, prime):
            bool_list[i] = False
